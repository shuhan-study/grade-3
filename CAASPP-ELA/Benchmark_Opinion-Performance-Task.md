# Grade 3 • Benchmark Assessment • Opinion Performance Task

##  Task: 

Your class has been learning about endangered animals. Your teacher has asked the class to think about which animal needs the most protection, the peregrine falcon or sharks. You decide to do more research on both animals. As part of your research, you have found two sources.

After you have reviewed these sources, you will answer some questions about them. Briefly scan the sources and the three questions that follow. Then, go back and read the sources carefully so you will have the information you will need to answer the questions and complete your research.

In Part 2, you will write an opinion paper using information from the two sources.

##  Directions for Part 1

You will now look at two sources. You can look at either of the sources as often as you like.

**Research Questions:**

After reviewing the sources, use the rest of the time in Part 1 to answer three questions about them. Your answers to these questions will be scored. Also, your answers will help you think about the information you have read, which should help you write your opinion paper. You may refer to the sources when you think it would be helpful. You may also look at your notes.

### Source #1: Saving the Peregrine Falcon

The peregrine falcon flies faster than any other bird. It can reach speeds of more than 200 miles an hour! The bird uses this speed to snatch its food with its strong claws when it is flying. Bird lovers have been interested in this special bird for a long time. It almost disappeared more than 50 years ago.

**The Disappearance of the Peregrine Falcon**

Starting in 1950, farmers began using a chemical called DDT. They put this chemical on crops to kill insects. About six years later, people noticed that many animals were dying, including the peregrine falcon. Then, in 1962, an expert named Rachel Carson wrote a book called Silent Spring. This book explained how harmful chemicals like DDT could be to the environment. These chemicals were killing the animals that ate
the insects.

For example, the chemical made the peregrine falcon’s eggs thin and brittle. When the females sat on their eggs to warm them, the eggs cracked. No baby chicks were born. There were fewer peregrine falcons each year. Scientists studied the chemicals, and they agreed with Rachel Carson. Then starting in 1973, harmful chemicals such as DDT were no longer allowed to be used in the United States.

**Protecting the Peregrines**

Peregrine falcons are strong fliers. They can fly thousands of miles in a year. Even though the United States did not allow the use of DDT, some other countries still used it. Peregrines could still eat animals that contained the chemical from other places. To protect the birds, scientists took some adult birds to a nursery to lay their eggs. Then they took the chicks to safe places. There the chicks could safely grow into adults.

Scientists chose Acadia National Park as one of the safe places. In 1984, scientists brought the bird to the park. In two years, they brought 22 chicks there when they were three or four weeks old. The park is a good place for the peregrines because it has high mountain ledges where the birds like to live. The birds were placed outside in a wooden box for three more weeks. They were fed food and water from a long tube. This meant that the chicks would not have contact with people. The chicks learned to live in their new home. Finally, they began to hunt for food on their own. When it was time to lay their eggs, they built nests at this site.

**A Success Story**

The first eggs from the replaced chicks hatched in 1991. From 1991 to 2011, at least 87 chicks have hatched in the park. Both Canada and the United States have worked hard to save peregrine falcons. Today, the peregrine falcon is back and stronger than ever. In some places, there are more peregrines than there were 60 years ago. For scientists and bird lovers, the story of the peregrine falcon is a success.

## Source #2: Endangered Sharks

Did you know that some wildlife organizations believe that one-third of all sharks may become extinct? Many scientists believe that about 100 million sharks are caught and killed each year.

Even though scientists are worried about sharks becoming extinct, scientists can only estimate how many sharks are in the wild. This means they do not know the exact number of sharks there are. There may be many more sharks than we realize. Scientists might be wrong about how few sharks are in the wild. They might be wrong about how many sharks are caught.

Scientists do know that there are over 400 species of sharks in the world. Sharks might be anywhere from 6 inches to 40 feet long, depending on the species. Some species are considered endangered. Many species are threatened. Threatened species may become endangered soon.

Some sharks are caught as bycatch. This means that they are caught accidentally while fishing for something else. Other sharks are caught on purpose. Many sharks are caught for their fins. In some cultures, shark fin soup is considered a delicacy. So shark fins are worth a lot of money in these cultures. Sharks are used in many other items, too. These goods do not list shark on their ingredient lists. Instead, they use words like squalene and shagreen.

Many people want to protect the shark population. However, it takes a lot of time and money to work with sharks, and even more research is needed. Satellite tracking tags are sometimes used by scientists to learn about sharks. Equipment, such as tracking devices and shark cages, is expensive. There are other methods to research sharks, but all methods cost money and time.

Governments have to spend time creating shark protection laws and voting them into effect. But laws are not enough. Wildlife organizations that protect sharks need donations to help pay for their work. Saving sharks is an effort that depends on everyone, not just scientists.

## Directions for Part 2

You will now review your notes and sources, and plan, draft, revise, and edit your writing. You may use your notes and go back to the sources. Now read your assignment and the information about how your writing will be scored; then begin your work.

**Your Assignment:**

Your school is organizing a fundraiser for the community to help endangered and at-risk animals. However, some people are not sure if the money raised should go to help peregrine falcons or sharks. Your teacher has asked you to write an opinion paper about the problem to share with the principal.

Your assignment is to use the information from the sources to write an opinion paper in which you convince your principal to use the fundraiser money to help peregrine falcons or sharks. Make sure you clearly state your opinion and write several paragraphs supporting your opinion with reasons and details from the sources. Develop your ideas clearly and use your own words, except when quoting directly from the sources. Be sure to give the source title for the details or facts you use.

**REMEMBER: A well-written opinion paper**
-   has a clear opinion, is well-organized and stays on the topic.
-   has an introduction and conclusion.
-   uses details or facts from the sources to support your opinion.
-   puts the information from the sources in your own words except when using direct quotations.
-   gives the title or number of the source.
-   develops ideas clearly.
-   uses clear language follows rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar usage).
**Now begin work on your paper.** Manage your time carefully so that you can plan, write, revise, and edit the final draft of your paper.
