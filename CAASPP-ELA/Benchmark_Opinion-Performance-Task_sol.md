Saving the Peregrine Falcon --> Animals become extinct when their homes are destroyed by humans creating buildings and roads.
Endangered Sharks --> Some animals are caught and killed by accident.
Chemicals can harm animals --> Chemicals can harm animals even after countries ban their use.
```


### 2
Explain what the sources say about endangered animals. Use one detail from each source to support your explanation. For each detail, include the source title.

```
The sources provided highlight different aspects of the endangerment of animals. "Saving the Peregrine Falcon" discusses how human actions, such as building and road construction, can destroy the habitats of animals and lead to their extinction. The source explains that this was the case for the Peregrine Falcon, whose population drastically declined due to the loss of its natural nesting sites.

On the other hand, "Endangered Sharks" highlights two different causes of animal endangerment. Firstly, it mentions how some animals, such as sharks, are caught and killed accidentally due to fishing practices. Secondly, the source discusses how harmful chemicals can harm animals even after they have been banned by countries. Both of these factors can have significant impacts on animal populations and contribute to their endangerment.

Overall, these sources demonstrate how human actions, including habitat destruction and harmful practices like fishing and chemical use, can have a devastating impact on animal populations.

### 3 
Explain which source has the most useful information about how to help protect animals. Support your answer with two details from your chosen source.

```
As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions, but I can provide an analysis based on the information provided.

In my opinion, the "Saving the Peregrine Falcon" source has the most useful information about how to help protect animals.

Two details from this source that support this claim are:

1. The source explains specific actions that individuals can take to protect Peregrine Falcons, such as reporting falcon sightings and monitoring nesting sites to prevent disturbance. This information is actionable and directly relevant to helping protect this endangered species.

2. The source also discusses the importance of government regulations and conservation efforts, highlighting successful conservation programs that have helped to increase the population of Peregrine Falcons. This information emphasizes the importance of collective action and can provide individuals with ideas on how to get involved in larger conservation efforts.

## Directions for Part 2

You will now review your notes and sources, and plan, draft, revise, and edit your writing. You may use your notes and go back to the sources. Now read your assignment and the information about how your writing will be scored; then begin your work.

**Your Assignment:**

Your school is organizing a fundraiser for the community to help endangered and at-risk animals. However, some people are not sure if the money raised should go to help peregrine falcons or sharks. Your teacher has asked you to write an opinion paper about the problem to share with the principal.

Your assignment is to use the information from the sources to write an opinion paper in which you convince your principal to use the fundraiser money to help peregrine falcons or sharks. Make sure you clearly state your opinion and write several paragraphs supporting your opinion with reasons and details from the sources. Develop your ideas clearly and use your own words, except when quoting directly from the sources. Be sure to give the source title for the details or facts you use.

**REMEMBER: A well-written opinion paper**
-   has a clear opinion, is well-organized and stays on the topic.
-   has an introduction and conclusion.
-   uses details or facts from the sources to support your opinion.
-   puts the information from the sources in your own words except when using direct quotations.
-   gives the title or number of the source.
-   develops ideas clearly.
-   uses clear language follows rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar usage).
**Now begin work on your paper.** Manage your time carefully so that you can plan, write, revise, and edit the final draft of your paper.

Opinion Paper: Helping Sharks is Essential

I believe that the fundraiser money should be used to help endangered sharks. Sharks are vital to our oceans and the entire planet, and their population is rapidly declining due to human activities. Here are three reasons why helping sharks should be our priority.

First, sharks are apex predators, which means they play a crucial role in regulating the ocean's ecosystem. If sharks were to disappear, it would lead to an imbalance in the food chain and eventually, the extinction of other marine species. According to "Endangered Sharks" source, sharks are caught and killed by accident due to the fishing industry. This can be prevented by funding more research and developing better fishing methods that minimize the bycatch of sharks.

Second, sharks are economically valuable. They are a popular attraction for tourists, which generates revenue for local communities. As per the "Endangered Sharks" source, shark tourism can be an alternative to shark fishing, creating jobs and sustaining coastal economies. By protecting sharks, we can also promote ecotourism, which benefits both the environment and the economy.

Finally, the peregrine falcon population has made a remarkable recovery since their endangered status in the 1970s. "Saving the Peregrine Falcon" source states that the peregrine falcon population has bounced back thanks to conservation efforts, and they are no longer considered endangered. Therefore, the fundraiser money would be better utilized to help sharks that are still critically endangered.

In conclusion, saving sharks should be a top priority for our fundraiser. We need to take action to protect them from human activities such as overfishing and pollution. By helping sharks, we can preserve the ocean's ecosystem, promote sustainable tourism, and ultimately benefit our planet's future.
