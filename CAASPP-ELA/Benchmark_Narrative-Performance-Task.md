# Grade 3 • Benchmark Assessment • Narrative Performance Task

## Task:

Your class has been learning about how animals protect themselves. Your teacher has explained how animals have their own clever ways of staying safe. You decide to do some more research on the topic. While doing your research, you read two sources.

After you have reviewed these sources, you will answer some questions about them. Briefly scan the sources and the three questions that follow. Then, go back and review the sources carefully to gain the information you will need to answer the questions and complete your research.

In Part 2, you will write a story using information from the two sources.

## Directions for Part 1

You will now review two sources. You can review any of the sources as often as you like.

**Research Questions:**

After reviewing the research sources, use the rest of the time in Part 1 to answer three questions about them. Your answers to these questions will be scored. Also, your answers will help you think about the information you have read and viewed, which should help you write your story. You may also look at your notes.

### Source #1: Hiding in Camouflage

In the animal world, there is one rule. It says, “Eat or be eaten.” Some animals can fly or run away from danger. Other animals use a trick to hide themselves. It’s called camouflage. Animals use their body color to hide. They also use their body shape to stay safe.

**Color Change**

Animals use their fur color to stay out of sight. They may also use their feathers or scales to hide. The birds in the forest use their brown feathers to hide in trees. Some animals can change colors. They are one color when they are young. Then as they grow older, the color of their fur changes. The color may change because they are now hunters. An animal’s color also changes with the seasons. For example, the Arctic fox is dark during the summer. The fox’s dark color blends in with the land around it. In winter, the fox’s fur turns white. It blends in with the snow that covers the ground. It makes it harder for other animals to find it in the snow. Some insects can change colors in seconds. They sense danger and their color changes.

Many kinds of sharks are gray, and dolphins are grayish blue. These colors help the animals blend in with the water. Most deer and squirrels are brownish gray. Their colors help them stay hidden in the forest. A grasshopper is green to blend in with the grass and other plants.

**Color Patterns**

Some animals use their spots or stripes to hide. These patterns make it easier for animals to look like the things around them. For example, the zebra’s coat is a pattern of stripes. In a herd of zebras, the white and black stripes all blend in together. The zebras look like one huge animal rather than just one zebra. A hungry lion has trouble seeing just one zebra in a group like that. Another animal that hides is the tiger. Its stripes help it hide in the tall grass.

**Two Colors**

Animals with two different colors can also trick other animals. They might have one color on their stomachs and another color on their backs. The two colors help them blend into many places in the forest. A red squirrel uses its reddish brown color to look like the forest ground. When the squirrel is in a tree it uses its white belly to look like the sky.

**Body Shape**

Another type of camouflage is when an animal uses its body shape to stay out of danger. While walking among trees, you may never see the walking stick. Its body looks like a branch. The praying mantis is another animal that looks like a branch. Grasshoppers hide in the grass and look like leaves.
Next time you are walking in the forest look for those animals that are hiding. Some may be using color to hide. Some may be using shape to hide.

## Source #2: Animal Defenses

The animal world can be dangerous. Some animals will run from danger. Some animals will fight back. Still others have different ways of defending themselves. Animals have to fight back to keep themselves from harm. Harm could mean death.

**Some Animals Run**

What will some animals do when they sense danger? Some animals will run. Yes, some will just run fast. Others have a special way of running away. The deer will first lift its white tail to warn others. Then it will start running left to right at a high speed. The deer hopes to confuse the animal chasing it.

Rabbits are also runners. They run away in a back-and-forth pattern. It makes it hard to follow them. Both deer and rabbits hope the other animal will give up. Ducks will fly away from danger. Some ducks will jump up and start flying. Other ducks walk fast then use their wings to fly. Once in the air, they are safe.

**Some Animals Attack**

Some animals will attack when they are in danger. The skunk first warns other animals by lifting its tail. It is the skunk’s way of saying, “Back off!” Then it sprays a smelly mist in the direction of the threat. The mist can be smelled for miles. It has a horrible scent.

Another animal that uses spray as a defense is the bombardier beetle. If it senses danger, it will mix chemical liquids that come from its body and fill its back end with those liquids. Then it sprays the liquid from its tail with a loud popping sound. Not only is the spray smelly, it is also boiling hot. Watch out!

On the other hand, a bee uses its stinger. It will buzz to let others know it’s around. If threatened, it will sting to protect itself.

**Unique Animals**

Did you know that some animals play dead? Well, they do. The opossum will fall over and curl up if threatened. Its tongue will hang out of its mouth. Once playing dead, the opossum hopes the other animal will lose interest and walk away.

Another great defense is puffing up the body. A toad will puff up its whole body to look about three times its normal size to keep predators away. Once bigger, it scares the other animal.

Two other unique animals are the worm and the turtle. It is not easy to tell one side of a worm from another. If a bird or other animal takes the back end of a worm, it can grow a new end. The worm gets a second chance at staying alive. The turtle has the best protection: its shell. If an animal tries to attack it, the turtle can pull all of its body parts into the shell. It stays safe. Teeth or claws cannot destroy a turtle’s shell.

How amazing are animals? Each one has ways of hunting, ways of eating, and ways of staying alive. There is so much to learn about animals.

**Your Assignment:**

Your assignment is to write a story about an animal in the forest who encounters an enemy. Write a story that is several paragraphs long about what happens to the animal. Writers often do research to add interesting details to the setting, characters, and plot in their stories. Be sure to use the information that you learned about in the sources when you write about your animal encounter. Make sure your story includes a setting, gives information about the characters, and tells what happens. Remember to use words that describe and don’t just tell.
