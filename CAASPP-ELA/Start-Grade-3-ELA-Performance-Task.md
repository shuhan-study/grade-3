#  Start Grade 3 ELA Performance Task

##  Astronauts 

1. Click on the boxes to match each source with the idea or ideas that it supports. Some ideas may have more than one source selected.

2. Explain why it is hard to be an astronaut. Give two reasons from Source #1 and one from Source #2. For each reason, include the source title or number. 

Sure, here are two reasons why it is hard to be an astronaut, along with their sources:

1. What is an Astronaut? By Talia Yee: "Being an astronaut takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Astronauts have to go through years of training to learn how to operate the spacecraft, perform scientific experiments, and survive in space." This means that becoming an astronaut requires a significant amount of effort and commitment. Astronauts must be willing to put in the time and work necessary to acquire the skills and knowledge required for the job.

2. Life in Space by Aaron Higgins: "One of the biggest challenges of living in space is dealing with the lack of gravity. Without gravity, your body experiences many changes, such as bone and muscle loss and a redistribution of fluids throughout your body." This means that astronauts must adapt to a unique environment where their bodies are subjected to a lack of gravity, which can have negative effects on their health. Astronauts must be prepared to deal with these physical challenges while in space.

3.     Student Directions

You will review your notes and sources, and plan, draft, revise, and edit your writing. You may use your notes and go back to the sources. Now read your assignment and the information about how your writing will be scored, then begin your work.

**Your Assignment **

Your teacher is creating a bulletin board display in the school library to show what your class has learned about different types of jobs. You decide to write an informational article on astronauts. Your article will be read by other students, teachers, and parents.

Using more than one source, develop a main idea about being an astronaut. Choose the most important information from the sources to support your main idea. Then, write an informational article that is several paragraphs long. Clearly organize your article and support your main idea with details from the sources. Use your own words except when quoting directly from the sources. Be sure to give the source title or number when using details from the sources.

**REMEMBER:** A well-written informational article
-   has a clear main idea.
-   is well-organized and stays on the topic.
-   has an introduction and conclusion.
-   uses transitions.
-   uses details from the sources to support your main idea.
-   puts the information from the sources in your own words, except when using direct quotations from the sources.
-   gives the title or number of the source for the details or facts you included.
-   develops ideas clearly.
-   uses clear language.
-   follows rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar usage).

**Now begin work on your informational article.** Manage your time carefully so that you can
1. plan your informational article.
2. write your informational article.
3. revise and edit the final draft of your article.

For Part 2, you are being asked to write an informational article that is several paragraphs long.

Remember to check your notes and your prewriting/planning as you write, and then revise and edit your informational article.

Astronauts: The Job of Exploring Space

Have you ever dreamed of traveling to space? Astronauts are the brave individuals who make that dream a reality. Being an astronaut is a unique job that requires extensive training, physical fitness, and the ability to work in challenging and dangerous conditions. In this article, we will explore the main duties and responsibilities of astronauts and what it takes to become one.

The primary role of an astronaut is to carry out missions in space. This includes conducting scientific research, operating spacecraft, and maintaining equipment. Astronauts work in teams and must be able to communicate effectively with each other and with mission control on Earth. In addition, they must be able to think on their feet and respond quickly to any unexpected situations that arise.

To become an astronaut, a person must first have a strong educational background in science, technology, engineering, or math. Astronauts typically hold advanced degrees in one of these fields, such as a master's or doctorate. They also must have extensive experience in their chosen field, such as working as a pilot or a scientist.

In addition to their academic and professional qualifications, astronauts must pass rigorous physical and psychological tests. This includes undergoing medical exams to ensure they are in excellent health and fitness. Astronauts must also be able to work well under stress and be able to handle the isolation and confinement that comes with living in space for extended periods of time.

Once selected, astronauts undergo extensive training that can last up to two years. This includes learning how to operate spacecraft, perform spacewalks, and conduct scientific experiments. Astronauts also undergo training to prepare for emergency situations, such as fires or equipment failures.

Astronauts work in a variety of environments, including the International Space Station (ISS), which is a research facility in low Earth orbit. The ISS is an important site for scientific research, and astronauts conduct experiments in fields such as biology, physics, and meteorology. They also perform maintenance tasks on the station's equipment and systems.

In conclusion, being an astronaut is a unique and challenging job that requires extensive training, physical fitness, and the ability to work in challenging and dangerous conditions. Astronauts play an important role in scientific research and exploration, and their work helps us to better understand our universe. If you are interested in pursuing a career as an astronaut, start by studying science and math, and working hard to develop the skills and qualifications you will need to succeed.

**Sure, here's a sample writing for a grade 3 student:**

```
Astronauts are people who go into space. They wear special suits to help them breathe and move around. Astronauts go to space in rockets. They do experiments in space and learn about space. They also take pictures of Earth from space!

Being an astronaut is a really cool job, but it's also very hard. Astronauts have to train a lot to learn how to be in space. They have to be very strong and brave too. When they are in space, they have to work together with their team and be careful so they don't get hurt.

I learned about astronauts from a book called "Astronauts: In Their Own Words" and a website called NASA Kids Club. These sources helped me understand that being an astronaut is exciting and challenging!
