“Hiding in Camouflage” gives information about how animals protect themselves with the colors and shapes of their bodies. Choose **two** details from “Animal Defenses” that give **different** information about the ways animals protect themselves.

-   A Sharks tend to be gray in color.
-   B Most squirrels can be two colors.
-   C Animals run to stay safe and avoid harm.
-   D Survival in the animal world is never easy.
-   E Walking sticks are hard to find in the forest.
-   F Some animals will spray a mist to stay out of danger.

```
The two details from "Animal Defenses" that give different information about the ways animals protect themselves are:

1. E): Walking sticks are hard to find in the forest. This detail suggests that walking sticks use camouflage as a defense mechanism to blend in with their surroundings and avoid being detected by predators.

2. F): Some animals will spray a mist to stay out of danger. This detail suggests that some animals use chemical defenses to protect themselves from predators by spraying a mist that irritates or deters their attackers.

### 2

Both sources discuss how animals protect themselves. What does “Hiding in Camouflage” explain about how animals protect themselves that “Animal Defenses” does not? Explain why that information is helpful for the reader. Give **two** details from “Hiding in Camouflage” to support your answer.

```
"Hiding in Camouflage" explains how animals use their colors and patterns to blend in with their surroundings, making it difficult for predators to spot them. This information is helpful for the reader because it helps them understand the various ways in which animals have adapted to survive in their environment.

Two details from "Hiding in Camouflage" that support this are:

1. "Some animals are colored in shades of brown or green, which helps them blend in with the leaves, branches, and trunks of trees and bushes."

2. "The shape of an animal's body can also help it blend in with its surroundings. For example, animals that live in rocky areas may have a rough, bumpy texture that makes them look like the rocks around them."

Both of these details show how animals use their physical appearance to protect themselves from predators. By blending in with their environment, they are less likely to be seen and caught by predators. This is an important survival strategy that has allowed many species to thrive in their respective habitats.

###  3 

Explain why animals can be sneaky. Give **two** reasons, one from “Hiding in Camouflage” and one from “Animal Defenses.” For each reason, include the source title.

```
Animals can be sneaky for various reasons, as explained in both “Hiding in Camouflage” and “Animal Defenses.”

One reason why animals can be sneaky is explained in “Animal Defenses.” The source explains that animals need to protect themselves from predators in order to survive. One way they do this is by being sneaky and hiding from predators. This helps them to avoid being caught and eaten.

Another reason why animals can be sneaky is explained in “Hiding in Camouflage.” The source explains that many animals use camouflage to blend in with their surroundings. This helps them to avoid being seen by predators or prey, making them more difficult to catch or find. By being sneaky and using camouflage, animals can increase their chances of survival in the wild.

Once upon a time, in a lush forest, there was a small, furry creature named Timmy. Timmy was a rabbit who lived a peaceful life among the trees and flowers. He enjoyed spending his days nibbling on fresh greens and hopping around in the sunshine. However, one day, his peaceful life was interrupted when he encountered a hungry fox.

Timmy had learned in his life about how animals protect themselves. He remembered hearing about camouflage and how it could help him hide from his enemies. So, he quickly looked around and saw a nearby bush with leaves that matched his fur color. Without a moment's hesitation, Timmy darted towards the bush and nestled himself within the leaves, hoping to blend in and remain unseen.

The fox, who was prowling nearby, smelled Timmy's scent and started to search for him. But because Timmy had hidden himself so well, the fox could not find him. The fox's sense of smell was not helpful in this situation since he couldn't see Timmy. Timmy stayed hidden in the bush until he was sure that the fox had given up and left the area.

As Timmy emerged from the bush, he knew that he had survived the encounter with the fox by using his knowledge of camouflage. He felt grateful that he had learned about animal defenses and how to protect himself. Timmy realized that he was not the only prey in the forest and that it was essential to be aware of his surroundings and use his knowledge of animal defenses to stay safe.

In conclusion, Timmy's encounter with the fox was a reminder that the forest can be a dangerous place. However, with knowledge of animal defenses and some quick thinking, Timmy was able to protect himself and survive the encounter. It is essential to learn about the ways animals protect themselves to stay safe and enjoy the beauty of the forest.
