# Grade 3 • Benchmark Assessment • Informational Performance Task 2

###   1 
Which warning sign of a thunderstorm is described in both sources?
A) how the air gets cooler
B) how the clouds look
C) how the sky gets dark
D) how the wind starts to blow

```
B) how the clouds look is described in both sources as a warning sign of a thunderstorm. Source #1 mentions "These frozen bits of ice move around in the cloud and bump into each other" and "When you see these kinds of clouds, you know a storm is on the way!" while Source #2 states "Dark, thick clouds" as a sign of a thunderstorm.
```

###   2 
Explain why a storm spotter would count the seconds between lightning and thunder. Give two reasons, using information from both sources. Be sure to tell which source you used for each reason.

```
A storm spotter would count the seconds between lightning and thunder for two reasons. First, it can help them determine how far away the thunderstorm is. They can calculate the distance of the storm from their location by dividing the total seconds by five, which will give them the number of miles away the storm is. (Source #1) Second, by reporting the distance of the storm, the weather center can warn the public and provide safety instructions accordingly. (Source #2)
```


### 3 
How does it most likely feel to be a storm spotter? Explain your answer by giving two examples from “Storm Spotters.”

```
Being a storm spotter can be a thrilling and rewarding experience, as it allows individuals to help keep their community safe during severe weather events. Two examples from “Storm Spotters” that illustrate how it might feel to be a storm spotter are:

Exciting: Storm spotters may feel a rush of excitement as they watch a thunderstorm develop and look for signs of severe weather. As described in the article, storm spotters “love the challenge of trying to predict what a storm is going to do,” and often feel a sense of satisfaction when they are able to identify and report potentially dangerous weather conditions.

Challenging: Storm spotting can also be a challenging and demanding task, requiring a great deal of focus and attention to detail. As the article notes, storm spotters must be able to “distinguish between different types of clouds and cloud formations” and “decipher radar images and other meteorological data.” This can be a mentally taxing task, and requires a strong knowledge of meteorology and weather patterns.

##    Directions for Part 2

You will now look at your sources, take notes, and plan, draft, revise, and edit your article. You may use your notes and go back to the sources. Now read your assignment and the information about how your informational article will be scored; then begin your work.

**Your assignment:**

Your class is creating a magazine about climate and weather. Each person has been assigned to write about a type of weather.

Your assignment is to write an informational article that is several paragraphs long . The article will help the students in your class know how thunderstorms form and what happens during a thunderstorm. The article will be read by the students in your class, parents, and your teacher.

Make sure to have a main idea, clearly organize your article, and support your main idea with details from the sources using your own words. Be sure to develop your ideas clearly.

**REMEMBER: A well-written informational article:**
-     has a clear main idea
-     is well-organized and stays on the topic
-     has an introduction and conclusion
-     uses transitions
-     uses details from the sources to support your main idea
-     develops ideas clearly
-     uses clear language
-     follows rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar)

**Now begin work on your informational article.** Manage your time carefully so that you can
1. plan your article
2. write your article
3. revise and edit the final draft of your article
For Part 2, you are being asked to write an article that is several paragraphs long. Write your response on a separate sheet of paper. Remember to check your notes and your prewriting/planning as you write. Then revise and edit your article.

Title: Understanding Thunderstorms

Thunderstorms are powerful natural phenomena that can occur anywhere in the world. They are a result of a combination of factors, including warm, moist air, atmospheric instability, and a trigger such as a cold front or a change in wind direction. In this article, we will discuss how thunderstorms form, what happens during a thunderstorm, and some safety tips to follow.

When warm, moist air rises and collides with cooler air, it creates an unstable atmosphere. As the warm air continues to rise, it cools and condenses into cumulus clouds. These clouds can grow rapidly into towering cumulonimbus clouds, which are the hallmark of a thunderstorm. Lightning, thunder, heavy rain, and strong winds are common features of a thunderstorm.

During a thunderstorm, lightning is a significant danger. It is formed when the positive and negative charges in the atmosphere separate, and the negative charges are attracted to the ground. When a lightning bolt strikes, it heats the air around it to around 30,000 degrees Celsius, which causes a loud booming sound that we know as thunder.

Thunderstorms can also bring heavy rain, hail, and strong winds that can cause damage to buildings, trees, and power lines. Flash flooding is a common occurrence during thunderstorms, and it can happen very quickly. It is essential to follow safety tips to keep yourself and your loved ones safe during a thunderstorm.

If you are outside during a thunderstorm, seek shelter immediately. Do not stand under a tree or any tall object. If you are in a car, pull over and stay inside with the windows closed until the storm has passed. If you are inside, stay away from windows and avoid using electronic devices that are plugged in.

In conclusion, thunderstorms are a natural phenomenon that can occur anywhere in the world. They are formed by a combination of factors, including warm, moist air, atmospheric instability, and a trigger such as a cold front. During a thunderstorm, lightning, thunder, heavy rain, and strong winds are common features. It is crucial to follow safety tips to keep yourself and your loved ones safe during a thunderstorm. Remember, when thunder roars, go indoors!
