# Grade 3 • Benchmark Assessment • Informational Performance Task 2

## Task:

Your class is creating a magazine about climate and weather. Each student has been assigned to learn about a different type of weather. Your assignment is to learn about thunderstorms. You have found two sources about these types of storms.

After you have looked at these sources, you will answer some questions about them. Briefly scan the sources and the three questions that follow. Then, go back and read the sources carefully to get the information you will need to answer the questions and write an informational article.

In Part 2, you will write an informational article using information you have read.

## Directions for Part 1

You will now look at two sources. You can look at either of the sources as often as you like.

**Research Questions:**

After looking at the sources, use the rest of the time in Part 1 to answer three questions about them. Your answers to these questions will be scored. Your answers will also help you think about the information you have read and should help you write your informational article.

You may look at the sources when you think it would be helpful. You may also look at your notes. Answer the questions in the space provided.


### Part 1  

### Source #1 Lightning and Thunder

Thunderstorms can make us want to curl up in bed and pull the blankets over our heads. First, lightning streaks across the sky. Then, there is usually a loud BOOM of thunder. What causes the lightning and thunder? Why do they happen during rainstorms?

**Positive and Negative Charges**

Lightning is a form of electricity. It builds up from positive and negative charges in the air. Thunderstorms occur when there are a lot of raindrops in the clouds. Sometimes the raindrops are frozen because the clouds are up so high. The higher the cloud, the colder the air is. These frozen bits of ice move around in the cloud and bump into each other. They create electrical charges that fill the cloud.

Some electrical charges are positive, and some are negative. In a cloud, the positive charges are at the top. The negative charges are at the bottom. They also build up under the cloud all the way down to the ground below. Positive and negative charges are opposites. They attract.

**Lightning Strikes!**

As the charges build up, they get closer and closer to each other. When they finally touch: ZAP! That’s when lightning strikes. Because of the way that positive and negative charges work, there are different types of lightning.

---

**Cloud to Ground Lightning**
-     Positive charge at top of cloud is attracted to negative charge on ground below
-     Lightning streak goes from cloud to the ground

**Cloud to Cloud Lightning**

-     Positive charge at top of one cloud is attracted to negative charge at bottom of another cloud
-     Lightning streaks across the sky, not touching the ground

**Intra-Cloud Lightning**

-     Positive charge at top of cloud is attracted to negative charge at bottom of cloud
-     Flickering light flashes inside a cloud

---

**Do You Hear Thunder?**

Lightning is always followed by thunder. Sometimes you hear it and sometimes you don’t. It depends on how far away the lightning is.

When lightning strikes, it creates a hole in the air that it passes through. As the air falls back in to fill the hole, it creates a loud sound wave. That is the thunder you hear after you see lightning. It is the sound of the air refilling the space that the lightning created.

You can find out how far away a thunderstorm is by counting how many seconds are between the lightning you see and the thunder you hear. Divide the total seconds by five. This will tell you how many miles away the storm is.

Lightning and thunder occur during rainstorms because the clouds need to be full of water to build up positive and negative charges. This happens in clouds that are tall and dense. When you see these kinds of clouds, you know a storm is on the way!

### Source #2 Storm Spotters

Weather centers use a lot of gadgets to help predict the weather. They use satellites up in space. They also use tools in the sky and on the ground. But one of the most important things that weather centers use is not a gadget at all. It is people!

Storm spotters are people who tell weather centers when they see a storm. These are volunteers who live in the community. They are trained by weather centers to know how to spot a thunderstorm. When they see the warning signs of a storm, they quickly call the weather center. The center then warns the public that a storm is on the way!

Sometimes, storm spotters follow storms, as well. They do this to figure out which way the storm is moving. They drive behind storms at a safe distance. Weather centers tell spotters to stay at least two miles away from the storm.

Without storm spotters, weather centers would not know exactly where a storm is or where it is headed. Storm spotters work with weather centers to make sure that people are ready for any storms that come their way!

**Signs of a Thunderstorm**
-     Dark, thick clouds
-     Dark sky
-     Cooler air temperature 
-     Increase in wind

##    Directions for Part 2

You will now look at your sources, take notes, and plan, draft, revise, and edit your article. You may use your notes and go back to the sources. Now read your assignment and the information about how your informational article will be scored; then begin your work.

**Your assignment:**

Your class is creating a magazine about climate and weather. Each person has been assigned to write about a type of weather.

Your assignment is to write an informational article that is several paragraphs long . The article will help the students in your class know how thunderstorms form and what happens during a thunderstorm. The article will be read by the students in your class, parents, and your teacher.

Make sure to have a main idea, clearly organize your article, and support your main idea with details from the sources using your own words. Be sure to develop your ideas clearly.

**REMEMBER: A well-written informational article:**
-     has a clear main idea
-     is well-organized and stays on the topic
-     has an introduction and conclusion
-     uses transitions
-     uses details from the sources to support your main idea
-     develops ideas clearly
-     uses clear language
-     follows rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar)

**Now begin work on your informational article.** Manage your time carefully so that you can
1. plan your article
2. write your article
3. revise and edit the final draft of your article
For Part 2, you are being asked to write an article that is several paragraphs long. Write your response on a separate sheet of paper. Remember to check your notes and your prewriting/planning as you write. Then revise and edit your article.
