Hello CAVA Families!

Happy 1st Wednesday back (again!)

In an effort to send this out quickly, I went ahead and made a video to help you and your student find the ELA Informative Essay Google Assignment.

First part is in English, 2nd part is in Spanish. ðŸ˜‰

-   **If your student completed it and you sent it to me today, GREAT! No need to upload it to Google Classroom.
-   **If you sent it to me before the break, please send it to me again (just in case).

If you prefer to take a picture of it and upload it to Google Classroom. Great! No problem

*However, please make sure itâ€™s a picture I can print. White screen, clear words, full page.

Please reach out to me if you forgot their Google Account username and password

Here is the link: https://youtu.be/BUEVVR6GFDM (same one as above)

Thank you for all that you do!!

Dear Prado,

How are you?

I did this homework a couple of months ago and sent it to you before the break.
Anyway, I asked my dad to resend it after the Wednesday ELA writing class. But my dad made a mistake and didn't send it out.
I will send this homework with this e-mail.


Thank you very much, 

Your student - Shuhan Geng
