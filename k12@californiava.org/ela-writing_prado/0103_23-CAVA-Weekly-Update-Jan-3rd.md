Hello CAVA Families!

I’m so glad to be back! Seeing student’s faces on the computer reminded me why I enjoy this group so much.

I hope everyone had a restful break and is ready to finish off Semester 1 strong.

**IMPORTANT:**

Jan 13 is the last day of Semester 1. All work completed online and submitted will be used for Semester 1 Report Cards.

I will send out a separate email regarding work samples. I understand Ms. Dockter received some of their work and I will need to look over her files before I get back to you.

However, if you know you (the parent/learning coach) has not submitted any work, please look through your student’s work to submit their assignments.

I am adjusting myself back into our school routine and it may take me a week to look through our Google Classroom and Ms. Dockter’s files.

In the event that you would like to ensure work is submitted, send it again.

**Also, I will be raffling off a few prizes tomorrow for our students who are doing great in their online ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies progress.

**Important dates to remember:**

*   January 13th ~ End of Quarter 2/Semester 1

*   January 16th ~ No School – Martin Luther King’s Day

*   January 17th-20th ~ No live sessions (SAI continues)

*   January 23rs – Semester 1 begins

*   January 30th ~ Spelling Bee

It’s that time of year again…CAVA Spelling Bee will be held at the end of January. Keep an eye out for more information coming soon.   3rd-5th grade- Jan. 30th 2:30-3:30pm

I look forward to working with your students again!
